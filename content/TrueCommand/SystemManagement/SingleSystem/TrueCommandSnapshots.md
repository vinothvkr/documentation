## View Snapshots

To view a system's already existing snapshots, click *EXPLORE* in that system's window and select a storage pool. Once the pool loads, select the *Snapshots* tab.

Set the task's schedule and determine the snapshot lifetime, then click *CONFIRM*.

## Timezones

When you create snapshot tasks, TrueCommand uses the system the dataset is mounted in to determine what timezone it will use. 

For example, if you are in New York and the dataset is mounted to a system with a Los Angeles timezone, a snapshot task set to occur at 12:00 P.M. will actually occur at 3:00 P.M. your time.

To see what timezone a system is in, go to that system's UI and navigate to **System > General** (**System Settings > General** in SCALE). 

That system's timezone information is in the *Localization* section. Administrators can change the system's timezone using the drop-down menu.
