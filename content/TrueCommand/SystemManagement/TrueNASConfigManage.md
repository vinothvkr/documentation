A maximum of one config backup per day can exist.  
If a prior config backup for the current day exists, creating a new one overwrites the previous one.

{{< hint info >}}
By default, TrueCommand retains seven backups. You can increase or decrease the number on the **Administration** page **Configuration** tab.
Local instances of TrueCommand can increase or decrease this figure as desired.
