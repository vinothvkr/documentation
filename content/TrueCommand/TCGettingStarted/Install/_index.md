TrueCommand is versatile and offers several different install options.
TrueCommand Cloud is the preferred method for using TrueCommand since it requires no local resources or specific hardware requirements to get started!

## Install Options

{{< expand "TrueCommand Install Options" >}}

## Managing a TrueCommand Cloud Account

From the account home page, click **Manage**.
Add a client for desktop or laptop to obtain a TrueCommand WireGuard Config file.

![CloudSubscriptionServiceDetails](/images/TrueCommand/Cloud/CloudSubscriptionServiceDetails.png "Account Services: Service Details")

After adding the client, click <i class="fa fa-download action-icon clickable" aria-hidden="true" title="Download WireGuard configuration file"></i> to download the configuration file.

![CloudSubscriptionServiceDetailsWireGuardClient](/images/TrueCommand/Cloud/CloudSubscriptionServiceDetailsWireGuardClient.png "Account Services: Downloading the WireGuard Configuration File")

Open Wireguard on your machine and click **Add Tunnel**.

![WireGuardTunnels](/images/TrueCommand/WireGuardTunnels.png "WireGuard: Adding Tunnels")

![WireGuardTCCloudInactive](/images/TrueCommand/WireGuardTCCloudInactive.png "WireGuard: Tunnel Inactive")

Click **Activate** to initialize the Wireguard tunnel.

![WireGuardTCCloudActivate](/images/TrueCommand/WireGuardTCCloudActivate.png "WireGuard: Tunnel Active")

See the [WireGuard home page](https://www.wireguard.com) for more information on WireGuard and WireGuard clients.

The TrueCommand Cloud IP address is on the iXsystems account portal.

When WireGuard is active, log in to the TrueCommand Cloud interface by clicking the TrueCommand IP address on the portal, or manually enter the TrueCommand Cloud IP in a browser.

## Connecting Systems to a TrueCommand Cloud Instance

Log into the ixSystems cloud account and click **Manage**.
Under **Service Details**, copy the **TrueCommand API Key**.

![CloudSubscriptionServiceDetailsWireGuardClient](/images/TrueCommand/Cloud/CloudSubscriptionServiceDetailsWireGuardClient.png "Account Services: TrueCommand API Key")

Log into a TrueNAS system and click the TrueCommand icon in the upper right.

Paste the TrueCommand API Key copied from the iXsystems Account Portal into the TrueNAS dialog window. 

![TrueCommandCloudConnectAPIKey](/images/SCALE/TrueCommandCloudConnectAPIKey.png "Connecting TrueNAS to TrueCommand Cloud")

When the True Command logo starts moving, check the TrueCommand Cloud email address for a verification message.
The email contains a link to the portal to confirm the connection and activate the TrueNAS system.

Click the **Discovered Systems** icon and select the TrueNAS system. TrueCommand automatically fills out the IP field using the WiredGuard address. Fill in the TrueNAS system nickname and password information from the TrueNAS system, and click **Add System**.

![NewSystemCreds](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/TC20NewSystemCreds.png "Registering TrueNAS in TrueCommand Cloud")

The TrueNAS instance can take 10 to 15 minutes to fully sync up with TrueCommand Cloud.
When all systems are connected to TrueCommand Cloud, refer to the [TrueCommand Administration articles]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/Administration/_index.md" >}}) for more instructions about setting up configuration backups, alerts, reports, and role-based access control.

## Installing the TrueCommand Container

{{< hint info >}}
If you haven't already installed Docker on your machine, install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/), then install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/).
{{< /hint >}}

To run TrueCommand in Docker on Linux, you must have:

* A 64-bit Linux distro (we recommend Debian) 
* Linux Kernel Support: 4.x+
* 1 CPU with 2 GiB RAM
* 1 Hard Disk with 10 - 50 GiB storage space
* Customer networking settings and internet access

Before fetching the TrueCommand docker image, create a local directory.
Enter `mkdir directory`, replacing *directory* with the new name.

After creating the new directory, fetch and run the TrueCommand Docker image.

Open a terminal and enter `docker run \--detach -v "/hostdir:/data" -p port:80 -p ssl:443 ixsystems/truecommand:latest`.

*hostdir* is a directory on the host machine for Docker container data, *port* is the TrueCommand web interface port number, and *ssl* is the port number for secure web interface access.

To install the container with an earlier TrueCommand release, replace *latest* with the desired TrueCommand version tag:  
`docker run \--detach -v "/DockerDir:/data" -p 9004:80 -p 9005:443 ixsystems/truecommand:1.3.2`

To install the container with the nightly TrueCommand release, replace *latest* with *nightly*:  
`docker run \--detach -v "/DockerDir:/data" -p 9004:80 -p 9005:443 ixsystems/truecommand:nightly`

{{< hint warning >}}
Only use the nightly version on test systems.
{{< /hint >}}

Although Docker containers have several run methods, TrueCommand requires`-v /hostdirectory:/data` to function.

{{< hint warning >}}
Do not try to use the same *hostdirectory* for two different containers!
Doing so results in file conflicts and database corruption.
{{< /hint >}}

For a list of TrueCommand versions and tags, see the [Truecommand Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ixsystems/truecommand/tags) page.

## Accessing the TrueCommand Web Interface

After fetching the TrueCommand Docker container, enter `docker ps` to see details about running containers.

![DockerContainerList](/images/TrueCommand/DockerContainerList.png "Finding the TrueCommand Container")

Use the port assigned to the container to access the web interface.
The list from `docker ps` contains a **PORTS** column.
Find the port associated with the **ixsystems/truecommand:latest** **IMAGE**.
The **PORTS** entry is listed as **0.0.0.0:port->80/tcp**, **0.0.0.0:sslport->443/tcp** where *port* and *sslport* are the ports specified earlier.

To access the web interface with no encryption, enter `hostsystemIPaddress:port` in a browser address bar, where *hostsystemIPaddress* is the IP address of the host system that is running the TrueCommand Docker container.
To access the web interface with standard SSL encryption, enter `https://hostsystemIPaddress:sslport` in a browser address bar.

{{< expand "The connection can't be established?" "v" >}}
When a connection to the web interface cannot be established, add the container ports as an exception to the host system firewall.

## Adding Browser Security Exceptions

TrueCommand uses a [self signed certificate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8705) for a secure connection.
Because of this, many Internet browsers consider the IP address or DNS host name untrustworthy.
In these cases, the IP address or DNS host name must be added as an exception to the browser to access the web interface.
Adding an exception is shown here for two different browsers, but the procedure is similar for most browsers.

### Browser Security Exceptions
