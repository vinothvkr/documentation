TrueCommand has a robust user management system that lets administrators personalize the experience for each user account.
You can create user accounts in the TrueCommand interface. Alternatively, LDAP can automatically create new user accounts when someone logs into TrueCommand with their LDAP credentials.

You can also manage many user accounts simultaneously by organizing them into Teams.

## Adding Local User Accounts

To create a new user account, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Users > + NEW USER**.
Assign them a descriptive name and authentication method.

TrueCommand uses the default authentication method to create unique credentials for logging in to the web interface.
The administrator must provide the user with their login credentials.

You can assign users to existing teams. After creating the team, you can add the user in the **New User** configuration panel by selecting **Teams** on the drop-down menu.
You can assign users to multiple teams.

If the user needs to be an administrator, check the **TrueCommand Administrator** box.

When finished, click **Create User**.

## Configuring User Accounts

To configure account details and permissions, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Users**.

![UsersList](/images/TrueCommand/2.1/UsersList.png "List of Users")

To edit a user click the edit icon <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i>.

![Users Edit](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/UsersEditUser21.png "Users Edit")

There are several different user elements that you can configure, including their avatar, personal details, contact email address, team membership, and system permissions.

### User Details

Users or admins can add personal details about the user on this page. 

To go back to the original contents of the fields, click **RESET FORM** before you click **SAVE CHANGES**.

{{< tabs "User Options Tabs" >}}
{{< tab "Administrator" >}}
You can select the **TrueCommand Administrator** checkbox to designate the account as an administrator. 
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Change Password" >}}
You can change the account password by typing the new password into both the **Password** and **Password Confirm** fields. When prompted, enter the user existing password. 
Click **SAVE CHANGES** to make the change.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Email" >}}
You can set up or change user email on this screen. If [SMTP]({{< relref "TrueCommand/Alerts/AlertManage.md" >}}) is not set up, an error message displays at the bottom of the screen stating **Failed to send email. Are your SMTP settings configured?**. Admins can click the **CONFIGURE** button to open the SMTP settings window. Before adding a user email, go to **Alert Services** and verify you have set up the SMTP service.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Two Factor Authentication" >}}
You can set user [Two Factor Authentication]({{< relref "truecommand/tcgettingstarted/useraccounts.md" >}}), which requires they enter a validation code emailed to them after they enter their username, password, and click **SIGN IN** on the login screen.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Joined Teams

The **CREATE A NEW TEAM** button displays if a TrueCommand team does not exist.
When teams exist, the **JOIN TEAM** button displays instead.

Click **JOIN TEAM** to display the list of existing teams, then select a team to add the user to it.
You can add users to multiple teams.
TrueCommand applies team permissions to any user added to a team, but setting specific permissions for users can override related team permissions.
Use the **Teams** screen to create new teams or edit existing ones.

### System Access

To limit non-administrative account access to connected systems, configure the **System Access** and **System Groups** sections.
You must first configure [system connections]({{< relref "ConnectingTrueNAS.md" >}}) and/or [system groups]({{< relref "ConnectingTrueNAS.md" >}}) in TrueCommand. Add systems from either the **Dashboard** or **Systems** screens.

Click **ADD SYSTEM** and select a system from the drop-down to give the user access to that system.
To restrict them to viewing system details, select the **read** permission.
To remove their access to a particular system, click **-** minus on that system.

When TrueCommand has system groups, the **ADD GROUP** button displays.
Click **ADD GROUP** and select a group from the drop-down to give the user access to all the systems in that group.
To choose the user group permissions, select **read** or **read/write**.
To remove their access to a particular system group, click **-** (minus) on that group.

```
docker exec -it [docker instance ID] resetpw [username]
```
