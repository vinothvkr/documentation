TrueCommand records all user activity in a system log.
For example, if a user deletes a system from TrueCommand, the log records which user deleted it, along with other information associated with the deleted system.

To view the system log, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Logs**.

You can also filter logs by entering strings in the **Filter** field.

Click an entry in the log to show detailed information about the event.
Clicking **DOWNLOAD ALL LOGS** downloads a <file>.json</file> file that contains all system log entries.
