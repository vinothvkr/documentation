{{< toc >}}

The network ports on a TrueNAS X-Series system are identified differently based on what software is installed.

{{< include file="/_includes/NetworkPortIdentifications.md" type="page" >}}

By default, an X-Series system with CORE installed identifies its network ports as **igb** followed by a number.
With SCALE, **enp** followed by a few characters.

This table lists the default identification for X-Series systems and any add-on networking cards that have been qualified for use with an X-Series system.
Some port identifiers are still being determined.
