{{< toc >}}

The network ports on a TrueNAS Mini are identified differently based on what software is installed.

{{< include file="/_includes/NetworkPortIdentifications.md" type="page" >}}

By default, a TrueNAS Mini with CORE installed identifies its network ports with **ix** followed by a number.
With SCALE, **eno** followed by a number.

This table lists the default identification for each Mini model and any add-on networking cards that have been qualified for use with a Mini.
