After you [download](https://www.truenas.com/download-tn-scale/) the <file>.iso</file> file, you can start installing TrueNAS SCALE!

This article describes verifying the <file>.iso</file> file and installing SCALE using that file, and selecting the type of installation as either on physical hardware or a virtual machine (VM).

## ISO Verification
The iXsystems Security Team cryptographically signs TrueNAS <file>.iso</file> files so that users can verify the integrity of their downloaded file.
This section demonstrates how to verify an <file>.iso</file> file using the [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) and [SHA256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234) methods.

### PGP ISO Verification

You need an OpenPGP encryption application for this method of ISO verification.
{{< expand "Click here for the verification process." "v" >}}
1. Obtain an OpenPGP encryption application to used. 
   There are many different free applications available, but the OpenPGP group provides a list of available software for different operating systems at https://www.openpgp.org/software/. 
   The examples in this section show verifying the TrueNAS <file>.iso</file> using [gnupg2](https://gnupg.org/software/index.html) in a command prompt, but [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) is also a good option for Windows users.

2. To verify the <file>.iso</file> source, go to https://www.truenas.com/download-tn-scale/, expand the **Security** option, 
   and click **PGP Signature** to download the Gnu Privacy Guard (<file>.gpg</file>) signature file. 
   Open the [PGP Public key link](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0xC8D62DEF767C1DB0DFF4E6EC358EAA9112CF7946&fingerprint=on&op=index) and note the address in your browser and **Search results for** string.

3. Use one of the OpenPGP encryption tools mentioned above to import the public key and verify the PGP signature.

   Go to the <file>.iso</file> and <file>.iso.gpg</file> download location and import the public key using the keyserver address and search results string:
   
   ```
   user@ubuntu /tmp> gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0xc8d62def767c1db0dff4e6ec358eaa9112cf7946
   gpg: DBG: Using CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag
   gpg: key 358EAA9112CF7946: public key "IX SecTeam <security-officer@ixsystems.com>" imported
   gpg: DBG: Using CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1
   user@ubuntu /tmp>
   ```
   
   Use `gpg --verify` to compare the <file>.iso</file> and <file>.iso.gpg</file> files:
   
   ```
   user@ubuntu /tmp>  gpg --verify TrueNAS-SCALE-21.04-ALPHA.1.iso
   gpg: Signature made Thu May 27 10:49:02 2021 EDT using RSA key ID 12CF7946
   gpg: Good signature from "IX SecTeam <security-officer@ixsystems.com>"
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: C8D6 2DEF 767C 1DB0 DFF4  E6EC 358E AA91 12CF 7946
   user@ubuntu /tmp>
   ```
   
   This response means the signature is correct but still untrusted. 

4. Go back to the browser page that has the **PGP Public key**. 
   Open and manually confirm that the key is issued for `IX SecTeam <security-officer@ixsystems.com>` (iX Security Team) on October 15, 2019 and is signed by an iXsystems account.
{{< /expand >}}
### SHA256 Verification
SHA256 verification uses the checksum to validate/verify the file.
{{< expand "Click here for the verification process." "v" >}}
The command to verify the checksum varies by operating system:

* BSD use command `sha256 isofile`
* Linux use command `sha256sum isofile`
* Mac use command `shasum -a 256 isofile`

Windows or Mac users can install additional utilities like [HashCalc](https://hashcalc.soft112.com/) or [HashTab](https://download.cnet.com/HashTab/3000-2094_4-84837.html).

The value produced by running the command must match the value shown in the <file>sha256.txt</file> file.
Different checksum values indicate a corrupted installer file that you should not use.

## Installing SCALE
You can install SCALE on either physical hardware or a virtual machine.

### Installing on Physical Hardware 

TrueNAS SCALE is very flexible and can run on any x86_64 compatible (Intel or AMD) processor.
SCALE requires at least 8GB of RAM (more is better) and a 20GB Boot Device.

#### Preparing the Install File

Physical hardware requires burning the TrueNAS SCALE installer to a device, typically a CD or removable USB device.
This device is temporarily attached to the system to install TrueNAS SCALE to the system permanent boot device.

{{< expand "Write TrueNAS installer to a USB stick on Linux" "v" >}}
To write the TrueNAS installer to a USB stick on Linux, plug the USB stick into the system and open a terminal.

Start by making sure the USB stick connection path is correct.
There are many ways to do this in Linux, but a quick option is to enter the command `lsblk -po +vendor,model` and note the path to the USB stick.
This shows in the **NAME** column of the `lsblk` output.

Next, use command `dd` to write the installer to the USB stick.
{{< hint danger >}}
Be very careful when using dd, as choosing the wrong *of=* device path can result in irretrievable data loss!
{{< /hint >}}
Enter command `dd status=progress if=path/to/.iso of=path/to/USB` in the CLI.

If this results in a permission denied error, use command `sudo dd` with the same parameters and enter the administrator password.

#### Installing on Physical Hardware From Device Media

Before you begin:

* Locate the hotkey defined by the manufacturer of your motherboard to uses in this process.
* Disable SecureBoot if your system supports it so or set it to **Other OS** so you can boot to the install media.

With the installer added to a device (CD or USB), you can now install TrueNAS SCALE onto the desired system.
{{< expand "Physical Hardware Install Instructions" "v" >}}
Insert the install media and reboot or boot the system.
At the motherboard splash screen, use the hotkey defined by your motherboard manufacturer to boot into the motherboard UEFI/BIOS.

Choose to boot in **UEFI mode** or **legacy CSM/BIOS mode**.
When installing TrueNAS, make the matching choice for the installation.
For Intel chipsets manufactured in 2020 or later, UEFI is likely the only option.

If your system supports SecureBoot, and you haven't disable it or set it to **Other OS**, do it now so you can boot the install media.

Select the install device as the boot drive, exit, and reboot the system.
If the USB stick is not shown as a boot option, try a different USB slot.
Which slots are available for boot differs by hardware.

After the system boots into the installer, follow these steps.

1. Select **Install/Upgrade**.
   
   ![SCALEInstallUpgrade](/images/SCALE/SCALEInstallMainScreen.png "SCALE Install Main Screen")

2. Select the desired install drive.
   
   ![InstallDrive](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallDriveScreen.png "Install Drive Screen")

   Select **Yes**.
   
   ![InstallWarning](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallWarningScreen.png "Install Warning Screen")

3. Select **Fresh Install** to do a clean install of the downloaded version of TrueNAS SCALE.
   This erases the contents of the selected drive!
   
   ![InstallFresh](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallWarningScreen.png "Upgrade or Fresh Install Screen")
   
   When the operating system device has enough additional space, you can choose to allocate some space for a swap partition to improve performance.
   
   ![InstallPartition](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallPartitionScreen.png "Install Partition Screen")

4. Next, set a password for the TrueNAS administrative account, named `root` by default.
   This account has full control over TrueNAS and is used to log in to the web interface.
   Set a strong password and protect it.
   
   ![InstallPassword](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallPasswordScreen.png "Install Password Screen")

5. After following the steps to install, reboot the system and remove the install media.

{{< expand "Troubleshooting" "v">}}
If the system does not boot into TrueNAS SCALE, there are several things you can check to resolve the situation:

* Check the system BIOS and see if there is an option to change the **USB emulation** from **CD/DVD/floppy** to **hard drive**. 
  If it still does not boot, check to see if the card/drive is UDMA compliant.
* Check to see if the system BIOS supports **EFI with BIOS emulation**, if not, see if it has an option to boot using **legacy BIOS mode**.

* If the system starts to boot but hangs with this repeated error message: `run_interrupt_driven_hooks: still waiting after 60 seconds for xpt_config`, 
  go into the system BIOS and look for an onboard device configuration for a `1394 Controller`. If present, disable that device and try booting again.
* If the burned image fails to boot and the image was burned using a Windows system, wipe the USB stick before trying a second burn using a utility such as [Active@ KillDisk](https://www.killdisk.com/eraser.html). 
  Otherwise, the second burn attempt fails as Windows does not understand the partition that was written from the image file. 
  Be very careful to specify the correct USB stick when using a wipe utility!

### Installing on a Virtual Machine 
{{< expand "Installation Tutorial Video" "v" >}}
{{< embed-video name="scaleangelfishvminstall" >}}
{{< /expand >}}
Because TrueNAS SCALE is built and provided as an <file>.iso</file> file, it works on all virtual machine solutions (VMware, VirtualBox, Citrix Hypervisor, etc).
This section describes installing on a VM using [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) on Windows.

#### Minimum Virtual Machine Settings

Regardless of virtualization application, use these minimum settings:
* RAM: at least 8192MB (8GB)
* DISKS: two virtual disks with at least 16GB, one for the operating system and boot environments and at least one additional virtual disk to use as data storage.
* NETWORK: Use NAT, bridged, or host-only depending on your host network configuration.

#### Networking Checks for VMWare

When installing TrueNAS in a VMWare VM, double check the virtual switch and VMWare port group.
A misconfigured virtual switch or VMWare port group can cause network connection errors for plugins or jails inside the TrueNAS VM.
Enable **MAC spoofing** and **promiscuous mode** on the switch first, and then the port group the VM is using.

{{< include file="static/includes/CORE/VirtualMachinesJailNetworking.md.part" markdown="true" >}}

#### Installing on a Generic Virtual Machine

For most hypervisors, the procedure for creating a TrueNAS VM is the same.
{{< expand "Genic VM Install Instructions" "v" >}}
1. Create a new virtual machine as usual, taking note of the following settings.

  * The virtual hardware has a bootable CD/DVD device pointed to the TrueNAS SCALE installer image (this is usually an <file>.iso</file>).

  * The virtual network card configuration allows your network to reach it. 
    **bridged** mode is optimal as this treats the network card as one plugged into a simple switch on the existing network.

   * Some products require you identify the OS you plan to install on the VM. The ideal option is **Debian 11 64 bit**. 
     If this is not available, try options like **Debian 11**, **Debian 64 bit**, **64 bit OS**, or **Other**. *Do not* choose a Windows, Mac or BSD related OS type!

   * For VMWare hypervisors, install in BIOS mode.

   * Ensure the VM has sufficient memory and disk space. For TrueNAS set to at least **8 GB** RAM and **20 GB** disk space. 
     Not all hypervisors allocate enough memory by default.

2. Boot the VM and install TrueNAS as usual.

3. When installation completes, shut down the VM instead of rebooting, and disconnect the CD/DVD from the VM before rebooting the VM.

4. After rebooting into TrueNAS, install VM tools if applicable for your VM, and if they exist for Debian 11, or ensure they loaded on boot.

#### Example VMWare Player 15.5 Installation
This example describes installing TrueNAS SCALE using VMWare Player 15.5.
{{< expand " Click here for more information." "v" >}}
Open VMware Player and click **Create a New Virtual Machine** to enter the New Virtual Machine Wizard.

1. Install disk image file.

   Select the **Installer disk image file (<file>.iso</file>)** option, click **Browse...**, and upload the TrueNAS SCALE <file>.iso</file> downloaded earlier.

2. Name the virtual machine.

   In this step, you can change the virtual machine name and location.

3. Specify the disk capacity.

   Specify the maximum disk size for the initial disk.
   The default *20GB* is enough for TrueNAS.
   
   Next, select **Store virtual disk as a single file**.

4. Review the virtual machine.

   Review the virtual machine configuration before proceeding. 
   By default, VMware Player does not set enough RAM for the virtual machine.

   Click **Customize Hardware...** > **Memory**.
   Drag the slider up to 8GB and click **Ok**.

5. Power on the machine after creation if desired. Select **Power on this virtual machine after creation**.
{{< /expand >}}
#### Add Virtual Disks
After installing SCALE on a virtual machine (VM), add virtual disks to the VM. You need a minimum of two disks, 16 GB each. 
One disk is for the boot environment the other for data storage.
{{< expand "Adding Virtual Disks" "v" >}}
1. After creating the virtual machine, select it from the virtual machine list and click **Edit virtual machine settings**.

2. Click **Add...** and select **Hard Disk**. Select **SCSI** as the virtual disk type.

3. Select **Create a new virtual disk**. Specify the maximum size of this additional virtual disk. This disk stores data in TrueNAS.
   If desired, allocate the disk space immediately by setting **Allocate all disk space now**.

4.  Select **Store virtual disk as single file**.

5. Name and chose a location for the new virtual disk.

Repeat this process until enough disks are available for TrueNAS to create ideal storage pools. This depends on your specific TrueNAS use case. 
See [Pool Creation]({{< relref "PoolCreate.md" >}}) for descriptions of the various pool ("vdev") types and layouts. 
{{< /expand >}}
#### Using the TrueNAS Installer 
Just as with installing SCALE on physical hardware, you complete the install in the VM by booting into the TrueNAS installer.
{{< expand "Using the TrueNAS Installer in a Virtual Machine" "v" >}}
Select the virtual machine from the list and click **Play virtual machine**.
The machine starts and boots into the TrueNAS installer.

1. Select **Install/Upgrade**.
   
   ![InstallVMMain](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallVMMainScreen.png "Install VM Main Screen")
   
2. Select the desired disk for the boot environments.
   
   ![InstallVMMedia](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallVMMediaScreen.png "Install VM Media Screen")

3. Select **Yes**. This erases all contents on the disk!
   
   ![InstallVMWarning](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallVMWarningScreen.png "Install VM Warning Screen")

4. Next, set a password for the TrueNAS administrative account, named `root` by default.
   This account has full control over TrueNAS and is used to log in to the web interface.
   Set a strong password and protect it.
   
   ![InstallVMPassword](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallVMPasswordScreen.png "Install VM Password Screen")

5. Select **Boot via BIOS**.
   
   ![InstallVMBootMode](/images/CORE/12.0/InstallVMBootMode.png "Install VM Boot Mode Screen")

After the TrueNAS SCALE installation completes, reboot the system.
The [Console Setup Menu]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenu.md" >}}) displays when the system boots successfully.
{{< /expand>}}

Congratulations, TrueNAS SCALE is now installed!

The next step is to boot up the system and configure SCALE network and general settings with the [Console Setup Menu]]({{< relref "ConsoleSetupMenuScale.md" >}}) so you can log into the web UI.
