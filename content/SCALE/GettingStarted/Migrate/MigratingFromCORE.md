{{< hint danger >}}
Migrating TrueNAS from CORE to SCALE is a one-way operation. Attempting to activate or roll back to a CORE boot environment can break the system.
You cannot upgrade CORE systems with High Availability enabled (HA) to SCALE HA.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
TrueNAS systems on 12.0x or lower should update to the latest CORE 13.0 release (e.g 13.0-U2) prior to migrating to SCALE.

#### Migrating GELI-encrypted Pools to SCALE
TrueNAS SCALE is Linux based, so it does not support FreeBSD GELI encryption.
If you have GELI-encrypted pools on your system that you plan to import into SCALE, you must migrate your data from the GELI pool to a non-GELI encrypted pool *before* migrating to SCALE.
{{< /hint >}}

## Migration Methods

You can migrate from CORE to SCALE using an <file>iso</file> file or a manual update file.
### ISO File Method

Start by saving the [SCALE ISO file](https://www.truenas.com/download-tn-scale/) to a USB drive (see the **Physical Hardware tab** in [Installing SCALE]({{< relref "InstallingSCALE.md" >}})). Plug the USB drive into the CORE system that you want to sidegrade and boot or reboot the system. 

At the motherboard splash screen, use the hotkey defined by your motherboard manufacturer to select a boot device, then select the USB drive with the SCALE <file>.iso<file>.

When the SCALE console setup screen appears, select **Install/Upgrade**.

The installer asks if you want to preserve your existing configuration or start with a fresh installation. We recommend selecting **Upgrade Install** when migrating from CORE to SCALE to keep your configuration data. Then select **Install in new boot environment**.

{{< hint warning>}}
Although TrueNAS attempts to keep most of your CORE configuration data when upgrading to SCALE, some CORE-specific items do not transfer.
GELI encrypted pools, NIS data, jails, tunables, and boot environments do not migrate from CORE to SCALE.
VM storage and its basic configuration is transferred over during a migration. You need to double-check the VM configuration and the network interface settings specifically before starting the VM.
AFP shares also do not transfer, but you can migrate them into an SMB share with AFP compatibility enabled. 
Init/shutdown scripts transfer, but can break. Review them before use.
The CORE netcli utility is also swapped for a new CLI utility to use for the Console Setup Menu and other commands issued in a CLI.
{{< /hint >}}

After choosing to install in new boot environment, the installer warns that SCALE installs into the boot pool previously used for CORE. Select **Yes**.

Once the installation completes, reboot the system and remove the USB with the SCALE <file>.iso<file> file.

When TrueNAS SCALE boots, you might need to [use the Shell to configure networking interfaces]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Network/_index.md" >}}) to enable GUI accessibility.

### Manual Update File Method

Start by downloading the [SCALE manual update file](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/).
Confirm that the TrueNAS system is on the latest public release, 13.0-U2 or better.

Click **CHECK FOR UPDATES** in the **System Information** card on the **Dashboard** or go to **System > Update**.

Click **INSTALL MANUAL UPDATE FILE**.

Click **SAVE CONFIGURATION** to download a backup file that can restore the system configuration in the event something goes wrong with the migration.
This is recommended but it not required.
![SCALEConfigSidegrade](/images/SCALE/SidegradeSaveConfig.png "Save the Config file")

Select a **Temporary Storage Location** (either **Memory Device** or a **Pool**) for the manual update file.
Click **Choose File** and select the <file>TrueNAS-SCALE.update</file> file you downloaded.
![SCALEFileSidegrade](/images/SCALE/SidegradeSetInstallFile.png "Settings for the Manual Upgrade")
Then click **APPLY UPDATE**.
  
After the update completes, reboot the system.

## Parallel SCALE CLI Commands

The following CLI commands are available after migrating from CORE to SCALE. The CORE equivalent CLI commands are for reference. These commands are for diagnostic use. Making configuration changes using the SCALE OS CLI is not recommended.
