TrueNAS SCALE incorporates all the major TrueNAS CORE storage and sharing features with a web interface based on Debian GNU/Linux.
Because SCALE shares the same UI as the FreeBSD-based TrueNAS CORE, users might notice there are similarities.
However, SCALE does incorporate some differences, primarily in component naming.

## Disks

TrueNAS Core utilizes a numerical listing of drives in a system.

TrueNAS SCALE uses a lettered format for drive identification.

{{< hint info >}}
SCALE still labels NVMe drives with a numeric value.
