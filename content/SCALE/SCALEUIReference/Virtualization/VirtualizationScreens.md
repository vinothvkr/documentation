The **Virtualization** option displays the **Virtual Machines** screen that displays the list of VMs configured on the TrueNAS SCALE system.

![VirtualMachinesScreenwithVM](/images/SCALE/22.02/VirtualMachinesScreenwithVM.png "Virtual Machine Screen")

If there are no VMs configured on the system, the **No Virtual Machines** screen displays. This also displays if you delete all VMs on the system.

![VirtualMachinesNoVM](/images/SCALE/22.02/VirtualMachinesNoVM.png "No Virtual Machine Screen")

**Add Virtual Machines** and the **Add** button in the top right of the screen opens the **[Create Virtual Machine](#create-virtual-machine-wizard-screens)** wizard configuration screens.

After adding virtual machines (VMs) to the system the screen displays a list of the VMs. 

Click on the VM name or the expand <iconify-icon icon="ic:twotone-expand-more"></iconify-icon> down arrow to the right of a VM  to open the details screen for that VM. 

The **State** toggle displays and changes the state of the VM. 
The **Autostart** checkbox, when selected, automatically starts the VM if the system reboots. When cleared you must manually start the VM.

## Create Virtual Machine Wizard Screens
The **Create Virtual Machine** configuration wizard displays all settings to set up a new virtual machine.

Use **Next** and **Back** to advance to the next or return to the previous screen to change a setting. 
Use **Save** to close the wizard screens and add the new VM to the **Virtual Machines** screen.

### Operating System Screen
The **Operating System** configuration screen settings specify the VM operating system type, the time it uses, its boot method, and its display type.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}

![CreateVirtualMachineOperatingSystem1](/images/SCALE/22.02/CreateVirtualMachineOperatingSystem1.png "Operating System 1") 

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Guest Operating System** | Required. Select the VM operating system type from the dropdown list. Select from **Windows**, **Linux** or **FreeBSD**. |
| **Name** | Required. Enter an alphanumeric name for the virtual machine. |
| **Description** | Enter a description (optional). |
| **System Clock**  | Select the VM system time from the dropdown list. Options are **Local** or **UTC**. Default is **Local**. |

![CreateVirtualMachineOperatingSystem2](/images/SCALE/22.02/CreateVirtualMachineOperatingSystem2.png "Operating System 2") 

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Boot Method** | Select the boot method option from the dropdown list. Select **UEFI** for newer operating systems or **Legacy BIOS** for older operating systems that only support BIOS booting. |
| **Shutdown Timeout** | Enter the time in seconds the system waits for the VM to cleanly shut down. During system shutdown, the system initiates power-off for the VM after the shutdown timeout entered expires. |
| **Start on Boot** | Select to start this VM when the system boots. |
| **Enable Display** | Enable a Display (Virtual Network Computing) remote connection. Requires UEFI booting. |
| **Display Type** | Select either [VNC](https://novnc.com/info.html) or [SPICE](https://spice-space.org/) from the dropdown list. |
| **Bind** | Select the IP address option from the dropdown list. The primary interface IP address is the default. A different interface IP address can be chosen. |
{{< /expand >}}
### CPU and Memory Screen
The **CPU and Memory** configuration wizard screen settings specify the number of virtual CPUs to allocate to the virtual machine, cores per virtual CPU socket, and threads per core. Also to specify the CPU mode and model, and the memory size.
{{< expand "Click Here for More Information" "v" >}}

![CreateVirtualMachineCPUAndMemory](/images/SCALE/22.02/CreateVirtualMachineCPUAndMemory.png "CPU and Memory") 

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Virtual CPUs** | Required. Enter the number of virtual CPUs to allocate to the virtual machine. The maximum is 16, or fewer if the host CPU limits the maximum. The VM operating system might impose operational or licensing restrictions on the number of CPUs. |
| **Cores** | Required. Enter the number of cores per virtual CPU socket. The product of vCPUs, cores, and threads must not exceed 16. |
| **Threads** | Required. Enter the number of threads per core. A single CPU core can have up to two threads per core. A dual core could have up to four threads. The product of vCPUs, cores, and threads must not exceed 16. |
| **CPU Mode** | Select the CPU mode attribute from the dropdown list to allow your guest VM CPU to be as close to the host CPU as possible. Select **Custom** to make it so a persistent guest virtual machine sees the same hardware no matter what physical physical machine the guest VM boots on. It is the default if the CPU mode attribute is not specified. This mode describes the CPU presented to the guest.  Select **Host Model** to use this shortcut to copying the physical host machine CPU definition from the capabilities XML into the domain XML. As the CPU definition copies just before starting a domain, a different physical host machine can use the same XML while still providing the best guest VM CPU each physical host machine supports. Select **Host Passthrough** when the CPU visible to the guest VM is exactly the same as the physical host machine CPU, including elements that cause errors  within libvirt. The downside of this is you cannot reproduce the guest VM environment on different hardware. |
| **CPU Model** | Select a CPU model to emulate. |
| **Memory Size** | Allocate RAM for the VM. Minimum value is 256 MiB. This field accepts human-readable input (Ex. 50 GiB, 500M, 2 TB). If units are not specified, the value defaults to bytes. |
{{< /expand >}}
### Disks Screen

| **Create new disk image** | Select this radio button to create a new zvol on an existing dataset to use as a virtual hard drive for the VM. |
| **Use existing disk image** | Select this radio button to use an existing zvol or file for the VM. Displays the **Select Existing Zvol** dropdown list field. |
| **Select Disk Type** | Select desired disk type as either **AHCI** or **VirtIO** from the dropdown list. Select**AHCI** for Windows VMs. **VirtIO** requires a guest OS that supports VirtIO paravirtualized network drivers. |
| **Zvol Location** | Select a dataset for the new zvol from the dropdown list of datasets on the system. |
| **Size** | Required. Allocate space for the new zvol. (Examples: 500 KiB, 500M, 2 TB). Units smaller than MiB are not allowed. |
| **Select Existing Zvol** | Displays after selecting the **Use existing disk image** radio button. Select an existing zvol from the dropdown list of zvols on the system. |
