The **Cloud Sync Tasks** widget on the **Data Protection** screen provides access to cloud sync tasks configured on SCALE and to configuration screens with settings to add  single-time or scheduled recurring transfers between TrueNAS SCALE and a could storage provider. They are an effective method to back up data to a remote location.

## Cloud Sync Task Widget
The **Cloud Sync Task** widget displays a list of tasks configured on the system.

![DataProtectionCloudSyncTask](/images/SCALE/22.02/DataProtectionCloudSyncTask.png "Data Protection Cloud Sync Task") 

If cloud sync task are not yet configured **No Cloud Sync Tasks configured** displays in the widget.

![CloudSynchTasksWidgetNoTasks](/images/SCALE/22.02/CloudSynchTasksWidgetNoTasks.png "No Cloud Sync Tasks")

Add opens the **[Add Cloud Sync Task](#add-and-edit-cloud-sync-task-screens)** screen. 
Each task listed is a link that opens the **[Edit Cloud Sync Task](#add-and-edit-cloud-sync-task-screens)** screen populated with with the settings for that task. Click on the **Description**, **Frequency** or **Next Run** column entry to open the edit task screen.

**State** displays the status of the next cloud sync task. Click on the state for the cloud sync task to display a **Logs** window for that task. Click **Download Logs** to save a copy of the current task logs.

The <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Run Now">play_arrow</i> **Run Now** icon starts the cloud sync, running outside of the time scheduled in the saved configuration. 

The <span class="material-icons">loop</span> **Dry Run** icon performs the same function as the **Dry Run** button on the add and edit configuration screens. It performs a test of the configured settings.

The <span class="material-icons">restore</span> **Restore** icon creates a new cloud sync task from an existing task that uses the same options but reverses the data transfer.

The <span class="material-icons">delete</span> **Delete** icon opens a simple delete dialog where you confirm before the system deletes the saved cloud sync task.

## Add and Edit Cloud Sync Task Screens

The **Add Cloud Sync Task** and **Edit Cloud Sync Task** display the same settings.

The **Add a backup credential** option on the **Credential** dropdown list opens a window where you enter the [cloud storage provider settings](#cloud-storage-provider-window).

###  Transfer Settings
**Transfer** setting options change the 

![AddCloudSyncTaskTransferAndRemote](/images/SCALE/22.02/AddCloudSyncTaskTransferAndRemote.png "Add Cloud Sync Task Transfer and Remote Settings") 

| Settings | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Description** | Enter a description of the cloud sync task. |
| **Direction** | Select a direction option from the dropdown list. **PUSH** sends data to cloud storage. **PULL** receives data from cloud storage and is the default setting. Changing the direction from **PULL** to **PUSH** or visa versa displays a **Transfer Mode Reset** information dialog and resets the **Transfer Mode** to **COPY**. |
| **Transfer Mode** | Select the transfer mode type from the dropdown list. To keep all files identical between the two storage locations, select **SYNC**. It changes files on the destination to match those on the source. If a file does not exist on the source, it is also deleted from the destination. To duplicate each source file into the destination and overwrite destination files using the same source select **COPY**. It copies files from the source to the destination. If files with the same names are present on the destination, they are overwritten. To transfer files from the source to the destination and delete source files select **MOVE**. If first copies files from the source to the destination and then deletes them from the source. Files with the same names on the destination are overwritten. |
| **Directory/Files** | Enter or click the <span class="material-icons">arrow_right</span> arrow to the left of <span class="material-icons">folder</span>/mnt and at each dataset until you locate the dataset, directory location you want to send to the cloud for push syncs, or the destination to write to for pull syncs. Be cautious with pull destinations to avoid overwriting existing files. Click the <span class="material-icons">arrow_right</span> arrow to the left of <span class="material-icons">folder</span>/mnt again to collapse the directory tree. |

### Remote Settings
The option selected in **Credential** changes settings displayed in the **Remote** settings area or it opens a window with [cloud provider settings](#cloud-storage-provider-window). 

![AddCloudSyncTaskRemoteS3Settings](/images/SCALE/22.02/AddCloudSyncTaskRemoteS3Settings.png "Add Cloud Sync Task Remote S3 Settings") 

| Settings | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Credential** | Select either **Add a backup credential** or a backup cloud storage provider credential from the dropdown list. **Add a backup credential** opens the cloud service provider settings window. The **Bucket** setting displays after selecting a credential that uses S3, like **Amazon S3**. TrueNAS automatically validates the selected credential. If you select a credential with invalid authentication settings the system displays an error dialog. Click **Fix Credential** opens the **Credentials > Backup Credentials > Cloud Credentials** configuration screen for that backup credential. |
| **Bucket** | Select the pre-defined bucket S3 to use. |
| **Folder** | Enter or click the <span class="material-icons">arrow_right</span> arrow to the left of the <span class="material-icons">folder</span> icon and at each directory or folder to reach the storage location to uses for this task. |

### Control Settings
**Control** settings establish when the cloud sync task occurs.

| Settings | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Remote Encryption** | Selecting **PUSH** in **Direction** encrypts files before transfer and stores the encrypted files on the remote system. Files are encrypted using the encryption password and encryption salt values. Selecting **PULL** decrypts files stored on the remote system before the transfer. Transferring the encrypted files requires entering the same encryption password and encryption salt used to encrypt the files. Additional details about the encryption algorithm and key derivation are available in the [rclone crypt File formats documentation](https://rclone.org/crypt/#file-formats). |
| **Transfers** | Enter the number of simultaneous file transfers. Enter a number based on the available bandwidth and destination system performance. See [rclone --transfers](https://rclone.org/docs/#transfers-n). |

Example: *08:00,512 12:00,10MB 13:00,512 18:00,30MB 23:00,off*. You can specify units with the beginning letter: **b**, **k** (default), **M**, or **G**. See [rclone --bwlimit](https://rclone.org/docs/#bwlimit-bandwidth-spec). |

### Add Backup Credential Settings Window 
After selecting **Add a backup credential** a new cloud storage provider window opens with TrueNAS **Name** and **Provider**, and after selecting the provider, the authentication settings that provider requires. 

![AddCloudSyncTaskAddBackupCredentials](/images/SCALE/22.02/AddCloudSyncTaskAddBackupCredentials.png "Add Backup Credential Name and Provider Settings") 

The settings in this backup credential window are also found on the **Credentials > Cloud Credentials** add or edit configuration screens. See [Cloud Credentials Screens]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/BackupCredentials/CloudCredentialScreens.md" >}}) for more information on the cloud storage provider authentication settings.
