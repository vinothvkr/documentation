When TrueNAS performs a scrub, ZFS scans the data on a pool.
Scrubs identify data integrity problems, detect silent data corruptions caused by transient hardware issues, and provide early disk failure alerts.

## Default Scrub Tasks

TrueNAS generates a default scrub task when you create a new pool and sets it to run every Sunday at 12:00 AM.

## Creating New Scrub Tasks

TrueNAS needs at least one data [pool]({{< relref "/content/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Storage/Pools/_index.md" >}}) to create scrub task.

To create a scrub task for a pool, go to **Data Protection** and click **ADD** in the **Scrub Tasks** window.
