In TrueNAS, user accounts allow flexibility for accessing shared data.
Typically, administrators create users and assign them to [groups]({{< relref "ManageLocalGroups.md" >}}).
Doing so makes tuning permissions for large numbers of users more efficient.

{{< hint info >}}
Only the *root* user account can log in to the TrueNAS web interface.
{{< /hint >}}

When the network uses a directory service, import the existing account information using the instructions in [Directory Services]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}).

Using [Active Directory]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Credentials/DirectoryServices/_index.md" >}}) requires setting Windows user passwords in Windows.

To see user accounts, go to **Credentials > Local Users**.

TrueNAS hides all built-in users (except root) by default. Click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true">settings</i>, then click **SHOW** to see all built-in users.

## Creating User Accounts

To create a new user, click **Add**.

TrueNAS lets users configure four different user account traits. 

{{< tabs "Account Options" >}}
{{< tab "Identification" >}}
### Identification

Enter the user full name in **Full Name**.
TrueNAS suggests a simplified name in **Username** derived from the **Full Name**, but you can override it with your own choice.

You can also assign a user account email address in the **Email** field.

Set and confirm a password.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "User ID and Groups" >}}
### User ID and Groups

Next, you must set a user ID.
TrueNAS suggests a user ID starting at **1000**, but you can change it if you wish.
We recommend using an ID of 1000 or greater for non-built-in users.

By default, TrueNAS creates a new primary group with the same name as the user.
To add the user to an existing primary group instead, clear the **New Primary Group** checkbox and select a group from the **Primary Group** drop-down list.
You can add the user to more groups using the **Auxiliary Groups** drop-down list.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Directories and Permissions" >}}
### Directories and Permissions

When creating a user, the home directory path is set to <file>/nonexistent</file>, which does not create a home directory for the user.
To set a user home directory, select a path using the file browser.
If the directory exists and matches the user name, TrueNAS sets it as the user home directory.
When the path does not end with a sub-directory matching the user name, TrueNAS creates a new sub-directory.
TrueNAS shows the path to the user home directory when editing a user.

You can set the home directory permissions directly under the file browser. 
You cannot change TrueNAS default user account permissions.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Authentication" >}}
### Authentication
You can assign a public SSH key to a user for key-based authentication by pasting the *public* key into the **SSH Public Key** field.
If you are using an SSH public key, always keep a backup of the key.
Click **Download SSH Public Key** to download the pasted key as a <file>.txt</file> file.

By default, **Disable Password** is **No**.

Setting **Disable Password** to **Yes** disables several options: 
* The **Password** field becomes unavailable, and TrueNAS removes any existing password from the account.
* The **Lock User** and **Permit Sudo** options disappear.
* The account is restricted from password-based logins for services like SMB shares and SSH sessions.

You can set a specific [shell]({{< relref "UseScaleShell.md" >}}) for the user from the **Shell** drop-down:

| Shell | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| csh	| [C shell](https://linux.die.net/man/1/csh) for UNIX system interactions. |
| sh	| [Bourne shell](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/v7/) |
| tcsh	| [Enhanced C shell](https://www.tcsh.org) that includes editing and name completion. |
| bash	| [Bourne Again shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) for the GNU operating system. |
| ksh93	| [Korn shell](http://www.kornshell.com) that incorporates features from both *csh* and *sh*. |
| mksh	| [MirBSD Korn Shell](https://github.com/MirBSD/mksh) |
| rbash	| [Restricted bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html) |
| rzsh	| [Restricted zsh](https://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/programming/linux/zsh-doc/zsh_14.html) |
| scponly | [scponly](https://github.com/scponly/scponly/wiki) restricts the user's SSH usage to only the `scp` and `sftp` commands. |
| zsh	| [Z shell](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) |
| git-shell | [restricted git shell](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shell) |
| nologin | Use when creating a system account or to create a user account that can authenticate with shares but that cannot log in to the TrueNAS system using `ssh`.

Setting **Lock User** disables all password-based functionality for the account until you unset it.

**Permit Sudo** allows the account to act as the system administrator using the `sudo` command. Leave it disabled for better security.

If the user accesses TrueNAS data using *Windows 8* or newer, set **Microsoft Account** to enable those systems additional authentication methods.

By default, **Samba Authentication** is enabled.
This allows using the account credentials to access data shared with [SMB]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/Shares/SMB/AddSMBShares.md" >}}).
