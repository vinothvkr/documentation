**Members** opens the **[Update Members](#update-members-screen)** screen. **Delete** opens a delete confirmation dialog.

## Add Group Screen

The **Add User** and **Edit User** configuration screens display the same setting options. 
Built-in users (except the **root** user) do not include the **Home Directory Permissions** settings, but all new users created, such as those for an SMB share like the **smbguest** user do.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **GID** | Required. Enter a unique number for the group ID (**GID**) TrueNAS uses to identify a Unix group. Enter a number above 1000 for a group with user accounts (you cannot change the GID later). If a system service uses a group, the group ID must match the default port number for the service. |
| **Name** | Required. Enter a name for the group. The group name cannot begin with a hyphen (-) or contain a space, tab, or any of these characters: colon (:), plus (+), ampersand (&), hash (#), percent (%), carat (^), open or close parentheses ( ), exclamation mark (!), at symbol (@), tilde (~), asterisk (*), question mark (?) greater or less than (<) (>), equal ). You can only use the dollar sign ($) as the last character in a user name. |
| **Permit Sudo** | Select to give this group administrator permissions and the ability to use [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/). When using sudo, a group is prompted for their account password. Leave **Permit Sudo** checkbox clear for better security. |
| **Samba Authentication** | Select to allow Samba permissions and authentication to use this group. |
| **Allow Duplicate GIDs** | Not recommended. Select to allow more than one group to have the same group ID. |

## Update Members Screen 

Use the **Update Members** screen to manage group permissions and access for large numbers of user accounts.
