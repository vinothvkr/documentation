| 22.12-BETA.1 | <a href="https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-117940" target="_blank">NAS-117940</a> | Implements temporary fix for the return from `glfs_open()` to honor `O_DIRECTORY` flag | Pertains to an internal issue in Samba. After gluserfs is fixed with a permanent solution to this issue happens, this temporary fix will be reverted. | Targeted 22.12 |
| 22.12-BETA.1 | <a href="https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-117974" target="_blank">NAS-117974</a> | Replication Task Wizard Source and Destination fields cut off the path information | The **Source** and **Destination** fields in the **Replication Task Wizard** window are cutoff. UI form issue that positions the paths in the fields such that ony part of the value is visible. | Backlog |
| 22.12-BETA.1 | <a href="xsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-118063" target="_blank">NAS-118063</a> | SCALE Cluder growth/resize features | Currently, there is no way to grow or resize an existing cluser without the user destroying their cluster and starting with a new cluster. This issue looks to implement a solution using TrueCommand and TrueNAS API that provides the ability to have shared volumes that do not occupy all nodes in the cluster, add one or more nodes to a cluster without impacting existing shared volumes, "grow" a shared volume, and temporarily remove nodes from a cluster without destroying the cluster. | Targeted Backlog |
| 22.12-BETA.1 | <a href="xsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-118066" target="_blank">NAS-118066</a> | UI is not updating or properly showing snapshots | UI isn't showing dataset snapshots without creating one from Shell, but the UI doesn't display this Shell-created snapshot in Manage Snapshots. | Targeted 22.12-BETA.2 |
| 22.12-BETA.1 | <a href="xsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-118054" target="_blank">NAS-118054</a> | Replication Warning: Cannot receive sharesmb property | Replication created sending from an ecrypted dataset to a non-encrypted dataset. After running replication the screen displays an orange warning icon. After clicking on the warning the "cannot receive sharesmb property in *tank/repwizrd/*set: pool and dataset must be upgraded to set this property or value." where *tank/repwizrd* is the pool/dataset path.| Targeted 22.12-BETA.2 |
| 22.12-BETA.1 | <a href="xsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-118095" target="_blank">NAS-118095</a> | Core dumps on ctdb at startup | Traceback received that indicates ctdb core-dumps when starting nodes after a fresh install. | Unscheduled |

| 22.02.0 | <a href="https://jira.ixsystems.com/browse/NAS-115238" target="_blank">NAS-115238</a> | Removed drive from pool does not degrade pool status (SCALE). | Issue is being investigated and a fix provided in a future release | Targeted 22.02.4 |
|  |  | Unable to mount an NFS export after migrating from CORE > SCALE or updating to 22.02.0. | The <file>/etc/exports</file> file is no longer generated when the NFS configuration contains <i>mapall</i> or <i>maproot</i> entries for unknown users or groups. This can impact users who previously had a mapping group set to <i>wheel</i>, which does not exist in SCALE. If you are unable to mount an NFS export, review your NFS share configuration and change any <i>wheel</i> entries to something specific for your environment or <i>root</i>. |  |
|  |  | SCALE Gluster/Cluster. | Gluster/Cluster features are still in testing.  Administrators should use caution when deploying and avoid use with critical data. |  |

{{< hint ok >}}
TrueNAS SCALE Bluefin includes Linux Kernel 5.15 which can enable Alderlake GPU acceleration by using the following boot loader tunable and rebooting:

`midclt call system.advanced.update '{"kernel_extra_options": "i915.force_probe=4690" }'`

NOTE: 4690 can be replaced with your specific Alderlake GPU version.

## OpenZFS Feature Flags

For more details on feature flags see [OpenZFS Feature Flags](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/Feature%20Flags.html).

For more details on zpool.features.7 see [OpenZFS zpool-feature.7](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/7/zpool-features.7.html).

| Feature Flag | GUID | Dependencies | Description |
|--------------|------|--------------|-------------|
| blake3 | org.openzfs.blake3 | extensible)dataset | Enables use of the BLAKE3 hash algorithmfor checksum and dedup. BLAKE3 is a secure hash algorithm focused on high performance. When enabled, the adminstrator can turn on the blake3 checksum on any dataset using `zfs set checksum=blake dset` [see zfs-set(8)](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/8/zfs-set.8.html). |
| head_errlog | com.delphix:head_errlog | n/a | Enables the upgraded version of `errlog`. The error log of each head dataset is stored separately in the zap object and keyed by the head id. Every dataset affected by an error block is listed in the output of `zpool status`. |
| zilsaxattr | org.openzfs:zilsaxattr | extensible_dataset | Enables `xattr-sa` extended attribute logging in the ZIL. If enabled, extended attribute changes from both `xattrdir=dir` and `xattr=sa` are guaranteed to be durable if either `sync=always` is set for the dataset when a change is made or sync(2) is called on the dataset after making changes. |

## Bluefin Unstable Nightly Images (Unstable Branch, developers and brave testers)

{{< hint danger >}}
Nightly builds are considered experimental and highly unstable.
Do not use a nightly build for anything other than testing and development.
{{< /hint >}}

Nightly images for TrueNAS SCALE are built every 24 hours, at around 2AM Eastern (EDT/EST) time.
These images are made publicly available when they pass automated basic usability testing.
This means that during times of heavy development, nightly images might be less frequently available.
Online updates are created every 2 hours and are available in the SCALE UI online updating page.
