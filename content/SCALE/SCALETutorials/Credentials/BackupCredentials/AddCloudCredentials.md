The **Cloud Credentials** widget on the **Backup Credentials** screen allows users to integrate TrueNAS with cloud storage providers. 

{{< expand "Is this secure?" "v" >}}
To maximize security, TrueNAS encrypts cloud credentials when saving them.
However, this means that to restore any cloud credentials from a TrueNAS configuration file, you must enable **Export Password Secret Seed** when generating that [configuration backup]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALETutorials/SystemSettings/GeneralSettings.md" >}}).
Remember to protect any downloaded TrueNAS configuration files.
{{< /expand >}}

TrueNAS SCALE supports linking to 18 cloud storage providers. Authentication methods for each provider could differ based on the provider security requirements.
You can add credentials for many of the supported cloud storage providers from the information on the [Cloud Credentials Screens]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/BackupCredentials/CloudCredentialScreens.md" >}}).
This article provides instructions for the more involved providers.

## Before You Begin
We recommend users open another browser tab to open and log into the cloud storage provider account you intend to link with TrueNAS.

Some providers require additional information that they generate on the storage provider account page.
For example, saving an Amazon S3 credential on TrueNAS could require logging in to the S3 account and generating an access key pair found on the **Security Credentials > Access Keys** page.

Have any authentication information your cloud storage provider requires on-hand to make the process easier. Authentication information could include but are not limited to user credentials, access tokens, and access and security keys.

   ![CloudCredentialsAdd](/images/SCALE/22.02/CloudCredentialsAdd.png "Add Cloud Credential")
   
2. Select the cloud service from the **Provider** dropdown list. The provider required authentication option settings display.
   
   For details on each provider authentication settings see [Cloud Credentials Screens]({{< relref "/SCALE/SCALEUIReference/Credentials/BackupCredentials/CloudCredentialScreens.md" >}}).

3. Click **Verify Credentials** to test the entered credentials and verify they work.

4. Click **Save**.

### Adding Amazon S3 Cloud Credentials
If adding an Amazon S3 cloud credential, you can use the default authentication settings or use advanced settings if you want to include endpoint settings.
{{< expand "Click here for more information" "v" >}}
After entering a name and leaving **Amazon S3** as the **Provider** setting:

1. Open a web browser tab to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. Navigate to **My account > Security Credentials > Access Keys** to obtain the Amazon S3 secret access key ID.
   Access keys are alphanumeric and between 5 and 20 characters.

   If you cannot find or remember the secret access key, go to **My Account > Security Credentials > Access Keys** and create a new key pair.

3. Enter or copy/paste the access key into **Access Key ID**. 

4. Enter or copy/paste the Amazon Web Services alphanumeric password that is between 8 and 40 characters into **Secret Access Key** 

5. (Optional) Enter a value to define the maximum number of chunks for a multipart upload in **Maximum Upload Ports**.
   Setting a maximum is necessary if a service does not support the 10,000 chunk AWS S3 specification.
   
6. (Optional) Select **Advanced Settings** to display the endpoint settings.

   a. Enter the [S3 API endpoint URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoints.html) in **Endpoint URL**.
      
      To use the default endpoint for the region and automatically fetch available buckets leave this field blank. 
      For more information refer to the AWS Documentation for a list of [Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_website_region_endpoints%20%20target=).

   b. Enter an [AWS resources in a geographic area](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in **Region**. 
      
      To detect the correct public region for the selected bucket leave the field blank. 
      Entering a private region name allows interacting with Amazon buckets created in that region.

   c. (Optional) Configure a custom endpoint URL. Select **Disable Endpoint Region**. 

   d. (Optional) Select **User Signature Version 2** to force using signature version 2 with the custom endpoint URL.       
      For more information on using this to sign API requests see [Signature Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html).

7. Click **Verify Credentials** to check your credentials for any issues. 

8. Click **Save**

### Adding Cloud Credentials that Authenticate with OAuth
Cloud storage providers using OAuth as an authentication method are Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photo, pCloud and Yandex.
{{< expand "Click here for more information" "v" >}}
After logging into the provider with the OAuth credentials, the provider provides the access token.
Google Drive and pCloud use one more setting to authenticate credentials.

1. Enter the name and select the cloud storage provider from the **Provider** dropdown list.

2. Enter the provider account email in **OAuth Client ID** and the password for that user account in **OAuth Client Secret**.

3. Click **Log In To Provider**. The **Authentication** window opens. Click **Proceed** to open the OAuth credential account sign in window.

   Yandex displays a cookies message you must accept before you can enter credentials.

   Enter the provider account user name and password to verify the credentials.

4. (Optional) Enter the value for any additional authentication method. 
   For pCloud, enter the pCloud host name for the host you connect to in **Hostname**. 
   For Google Drive when connecting to **Team Drive**, enter the Google Drive top-level folder ID.

5. If not populated by the provider after OAuth authentication, enter the access token from the provider. Obtaining the access token varies by provider.
   
   | Provider | Access Token |
   |----------|--------------|
   | Box | For more information the user acess token for Box [click here](https://developer.box.com/). An [access token](https://developer.box.com/reference/) enables Box to verify a request belongs to an authorized session. Example token: T9cE5asGnuyYCCqIZFoWjFHvNbvVqHjl. |
   | Dropbox | Create an access [token](https://dropbox.tech/developers/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account) from the [Dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/). |
   | Google Drive | The authentication process creates the token for [Google Drive](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-auth) and populates the **Access Token** field automatically. Access tokens expire periodically, so you must refresh them. |
   | Google Photo | does not used an access token. |
   | pCloud | Create the pCloud access token [here](https://docs.pcloud.com/methods/intro/authentication.html). These tokens can expire and require an extension. |
   | Yandex | Create the Yandex access token [here](https://yandex.com/dev/direct/doc/dg-v4/concepts/auth-token.html). |

6. Click **Verify Credentials** to make sure you can connect with the entered credentials.

7. Click **Save**.

From the **Cloud Credentials** widget, click **Add** and then:

1. Enter the name and select **Google Cloud Storage** from the **Provider** dropdown list.

2. Go to your Google Cloud Storage website to download this file to the TrueNAS SCALE server. 
   The [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) creates the file.

3. Upload the json file to **Preview JSON Service Account Key** using **Choose File** to browse the server to locate the downloaded file.

## Using Automatic Authentication

Some providers can automatically populate the required authentication strings by logging in to the account.
To automatically configure the credential, click **Login to Provider** and entering your account user name and password.
