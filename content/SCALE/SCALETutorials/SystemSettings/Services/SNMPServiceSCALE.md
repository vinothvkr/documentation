[SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1157) monitors network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention.
TrueNAS uses [Net-SNMP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp/) to provide SNMP.
To configure SNMP, go to **System Settings > Services** page, find **SNMP**, and click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i>.

See [SNMP Service Screen]({{< relref "SNMPServiceScreenSCALE.md" >}}) for setting information. 

Port **UDP 161** listens for SNMP requests when starting the SNMP service.

## Management Information Bases (MIBs)

Available Management Information Bases (MIBs) are located in <file>/usr/local/share/snmp/mibs</file>.
This directory contains many files routinely added or removed from the directory.
Check the directory on your system by going to **System Settings > Shell** and entering `ls /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs`.
Here is a sample of the directory contents:
