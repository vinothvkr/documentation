TrueNAS does not limit the number of potential snapshots you can store/keep. 
However, as the number of snapshots moves into the thousands, the administration of snapshots via the webUI becomes more difficult, and the performance of some functions degrades. 
Stagger deletion of snapshots and don't perform them simultaneously. iXsystems recommends using and keeping snapshots where needed.
