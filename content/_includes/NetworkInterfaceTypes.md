**LAGG (Link Aggregation)**

You should use LAGG if you want to optimize multi-user performance, balance network traffic, or have network failover protection.

For example, Failover LAGG prevents a network outage by dynamically reassigning traffic to another interface when one physical link (a cable or NIC) fails.

**Network Bridge**

You should use a Bridge if you want to enable communication between two networks and provide a way for them to work as a single network.

For example, bridges can serve IPs to multiple VMs on one interface, which allows your VMs to be on the same network as the host.
