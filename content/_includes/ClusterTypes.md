* **Distributed** - Distribute files across the bricks in the volume. You can use distributed volumes where the requirement is to scale storage and the redundancy is either not important or is provided by other hardware/software layers.
* **Replicated** - Replicate files across bricks in the volume. You can use replicated volumes in environments where high-availability and high-reliability are critical.
* **Distributed** Replicated - Distribute files across replicated bricks in the volume. You can use distributed replicated volumes in environments where the requirement is to scale storage and high-reliability is critical. Distributed replicated volumes also offer improved read performance in most environments. Requires setting an additional **Replica Count**
* **Dispersed** - Dispersed volumes are based on erasure codes, providing space-efficient protection against disk or server failures. It stores an encoded fragment of the original file to each brick in a way that only a subset of the fragments is needed to recover the original file. The number of bricks that can be missing without losing access to data is configured by the administrator on volume creation time. Requires setting an additional **Redundancy Count**.
