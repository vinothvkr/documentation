### Method 1: Construct JSON Manifest"
1. Replicate every encrypted dataset you want to replicate with properties. 

2. Export key for every child dataset that has a unique key. 

3. For each child dataset construct a proper json with poolname/datasetname of the destination system and key from the source system like this: 
   `{"tank/share01": "57112db4be777d93fa7b76138a68b790d46d6858569bf9d13e32eb9fda72146b"}`

5. Save this file with the extension <file>.json<file>. 

6. On the remote system, unlock the dataset(s) using properly constructed <file>json<file> files.

### Method 2: Replicate Encrypted Dataset/zvol Without Properties"
Uncheck properties when replicating so that the destination dataset is not encrypted on the remote side and does not require a key to unlock.
1. Go to **Data Protection** and click **ADD** in the **Replication Tasks** window.

2. Click **Advanced Replication Creation**.

3. Fill out the form as needed and make sure **Include Dataset Properties** is *NOT* checked.

4. Click **Save**.

### Method 3: Replicate Key Encrypted Dataset/zvol
1. Go to **Storage -> pool/root dataset** on the replication system. Click <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> and select **Export Key**.

2. Apply the key file or key code to the dataset. 
   Either download the key file, open that file and change the *pool name/dataset* to the receiving *pool name/dataset*, or copy the key code provided in the **Key** window.

3. On the receiving pool/dataset: Click <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> next to pool/dataset and select **Unlock**.

4. Unlock the dataset. 
   Either clear the **Unlock with Key file** checkbox, paste the Key Code into **Dataset Key** field (if there is a space character at the end of the key, delete the space), or select the downloaded Key file that was edited.

5. Click **Save**.

5. Click **Continue**.
