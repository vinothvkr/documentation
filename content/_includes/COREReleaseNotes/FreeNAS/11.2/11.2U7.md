**November 19, 2019**

The FreeNAS development team is pleased to announce the availability of the seventh update to FreeNAS 11.2. This is a bug fix release.

Users of 11.2 systems are encouraged to update to 11.2-U7 using the instructions in the Guide.

## Known Impacts

The default ACL on new ‘Windows’ datasets was changed from:
```
owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow
```

to:
```
owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
everyone@::fd:allow
```

This means that world is no longer being granted read privileges by default on newly created SMB shares. If you need to add “read” to “world” on a newly-created dataset, you can run the command:

`setfacl -m everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow /mnt/path/to/dataset`

## Known Issues

The hubiC cloud service has suspended creation of new accounts.

The Mega cloud service is currently broken. The new version of rclone which fixes this will be available in 11.3.

As an edge case, if you install another instance of an already installed plugin and that plugin installation fails, the cleanup from the failure will also delete the dataset for the first installation of that plugin. As a workaround until this is fixed in 11.3, it is recommended that users wanting to install another version of an installed plugin perform the installation from the CLI, using the -k switch:

`iocage fetch -P -n PLUGIN_NAME -k RESTOFPARAMS`
