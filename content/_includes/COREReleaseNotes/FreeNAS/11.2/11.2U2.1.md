FreeNAS 11.2-U2.1 is a hot fix release to address an iocage and a Samba regression discovered in FreeNAS 11.2-U2. Users of 11.2 systems are encouraged to apply the hot fix using the update instructions in the Guide.

Important: users currently running 11.2-U2 who explicitly set vnet_default_interace to none will need to reapply that change after updating to 11.2-U2.1.

## Known Impacts

SMB fails to start when LDAP is enabled in an environment with a read-only bind account. This is because Samba tries to create a BUILTIN\Guests alias, and treats failure as fatal error. Current mitigations are to either: 1) allow Samba to write the guest alias to the LDAP server by temporarily using a read-write account, or to 2) set “winbind nested groups = no” as an Auxiliary Parameter in Services → SMB.
