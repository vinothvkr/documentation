The FreeNAS development team is pleased to announce the availability of the sixth update to FreeNAS 11.2. This bug fix release adds some operating system and ZFS fixes and addresses these security vulnerabilities:

* FreeBSD-EN-19:12.tzdata
* FreeBSD-EN-19:13.mds
* FreeBSD-SA-19:09.iconv
* FreeBSD-SA-19:10.ufs
* FreeBSD-SA-19:11.cd_ioctl
* FreeBSD-SA-19:12.telnet
* FreeBSD-SA-19:13.pts
* FreeBSD-SA-19:14.freebsd32
* FreeBSD-SA-19:15.mqueuefs
* FreeBSD-SA-19:16.bhyve
* FreeBSD-SA-19:17.fd
* FreeBSD-SA-19:18.bzip2
* FreeBSD-SA-19:19.mldv2
* FreeBSD-SA-19:20.bsnmp
* FreeBSD-SA-19:21.bhyve
* CVE-2019-10197
* CVE 2019-3829
* CVE 2019-3836

The iconik plugin has been added. More information about iconik, a getting started guide, and an offer for 300 free credits is available here.

The Amazon Cloud Drive provider has been removed from **System > Cloud Credentials**. See this rclone forum post about Amazon Drive for more details.

Users of 11.2 systems are encouraged to update to 11.2-U6 using the instructions in the Guide.

## Known Impacts

The default ACL on new ‘Windows’ datasets was changed from:
```
owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow
```

to:
```
owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow
everyone@::fd:allow
```

This means that world is no longer being granted read privileges by default on newly created SMB shares. If you need to add “read” to “world” on a newly-created dataset, you can run the command:

`setfacl -m everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow /mnt/path/to/dataset`

## Known Issues

OAuth Cloud Credentials support will be added to the new UI in 11.3. For 11.2-U6, the legacy UI can be used to automatically populate credentials for supported cloud providers.

The hubiC cloud service has suspended creation of new accounts.

The Mega cloud service is currently broken. The new version of rclone which fixes this will be available in 11.3.

As an edge case, if you install another instance of an already installed plugin and that plugin installation fails, the cleanup from the failure will also delete the dataset for the first installation of that plugin. As a workaround until this is fixed in 11.3, it is recommended that users wanting to install another version of an installed plugin perform the installation from the CLI, using the -k switch:

`iocage fetch -P -n PLUGIN_NAME -k RESTOFPARAMS`
