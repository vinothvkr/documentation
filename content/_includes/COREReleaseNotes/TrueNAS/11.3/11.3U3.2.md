**June 9, 2020**

iXsystems is pleased to release Update 3.2 for TrueNAS 11.3! TrueNAS 11.3-U3.2 is a maintenance release that includes all the bug fixes and quality of life improvements from the FreeNAS 11.3-U3, 11.3-U3.1, and 11.3-U3.2 releases. Notable TrueNAS-specific improvements include fixes to the debug file output, network interfaces settings rollback for High Availability (HA) systems, alert system bugs, and a fix for the HA Disabled icon.

## Known Issues

Saving a Link Aggregation (lagg) in the new UI requires setting a Failover Group, VHID, and IP addresses for the lagg, which can prevent creating a vlan lagg on an HA system (NAS-106366).

### Workaround

For HA systems with TrueNAS 11.3-U3.2 and previous versions of TrueNAS that include the new UI, switch to the legacy UI when configuring a vlan lagg:

In the new UI, go to **System > Advanced**, set *Enable Legacy User Interface*, and click **Save**.

To log in to the Legacy UI, log out of the new UI, and click the “Legacy User Interface” button on the login screen.

To create a lagg in the legacy UI, go to **Network > Link Aggregations** and click **Add Link Aggregation**.

### Issue

The UI can become unresponsive after upgrading (NAS-104277).

### Workaround

Clear the site data and refresh the page (Shift + F5).
