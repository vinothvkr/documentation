**October 1, 2019**

iXsystems is pleased to announce the general availability of TrueNAS 11.2-U6. This bug fix release adds some operating system and ZFS fixes and addresses these security vulnerabilities:

+ FreeBSD-EN-19:12.tzdata
+ FreeBSD-EN-19:13.mds
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:09.iconv
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:10.ufs
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:11.cd_ioctl
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:12.telnet
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:13.pts
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:14.freebsd32
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:15.mqueuefs
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:16.bhyve
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:17.fd
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:18.bzip2
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:19.mldv2
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:20.bsnmp
+ FreeBSD-SA-19:21.bhyve
+ CVE-2019-10197
+ CVE 2019-3829
+ CVE 2019-3836

The Asigra service has been updated to DS-Operator version 14.1.0.0.

The iconik plugin has been added. More information about iconik, a getting started guide, and an offer for 300 free credits is available here.

The Amazon Cloud Drive provider has been removed from **System > Cloud Credentials**. See this rclone forum post about Amazon Drive for more details.

Before updating, contact iXsystems Technical Support for a pre-update health check and to answer any technical questions regarding this update. You can contact Support by calling 1-855-GREP-4-iX or emailing support@ixsystems.com.

## Known Impacts

The default ACL on new Windows datasets was changed from:

`owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow`

`group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow`

`everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow`

to:

`owner@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow`

`group@:rwxpDdaARWcCos:fd:allow`

`everyone@::fd:allow`

This means that world is no longer being granted read privileges by default on newly created SMB shares. If you need to add “read” to “world” on a newly-created dataset, run the command:

`setfacl -m everyone@:rxaRc:fd:allow /mnt/path/to/dataset`

## Known Issues

TrueNAS NFSv4 exports do not work in a VMWare cluster at this time. NFSv3 will need to be used as a work-around.

The hubiC cloud service has suspended creation of new accounts.

The Mega cloud service is currently broken. The new version of rclone which fixes this will be available in 11.3.

When performing an update on HA systems, the “Apply Pending Updates” button does not apply the update. Instead, select the “Check Now” option.

If the email address configured in **Services > S.M.A.R.T. > Email** differs from the root user email address configured in **Account > Users**, only the root user email address will receive an email alert when there is a S.M.A.R.T. failure. If these email addresses need to differ, the workaround is to configure **System > Alert Services**.
