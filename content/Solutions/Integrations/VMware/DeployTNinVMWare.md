This article describes deploying TrueNAS CORE virtual machine (VM) in a VMWare ESXi environment. 
ESXi version 6.7 is shown in this article.

## Before You Begin

Before starting configuration work in VMWare:

* Allocate a drive or a few drives in your server cluster for the TrueNAS virtual machine. 
  The anticipated storage needs for your deployment determines the size and number of drives you need.

* Download the CORE 13.0 iso file from the [TrueNAS.com/downloads web page](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-core/).

* Visit the [TrueNAS CORE Hardware Guide]({{< relref "/content/core/gettingstarted/corehardwareguide.md" >}}) and take note of the minimal system requirements.
  Also note the information in the **Memory** and **Storage Device Sizing** sections.

  The hardware guide provides guidance on how much memory, the number of CPUs, and drive size you need to configure. For example, you need a minimum of 2 CPUS, 8 GB memory, and two drives each with at least 16 GB storage. You can increase memory and drive sizes if you want to improve performance. 

* Determine your data storage requirements. Consider the number of storage pools and the type of storage you need for your deployment or how you plan to use the TrueNAS. 
  See [Storage Configuration]({{< relref "/content/CORE/GettingStarted/StoringData.md" >}}) for information on pool layouts. 

  This article provides guidance on the number of virtual hard drives (vmdks) you want to create when setting up your virtual machine. 
  For example, if you want a mirror layout you need to add a minimum of three drives. One for the boot drive and two for the mirrored storage.
  If you want a mirror with a hot spare, you need to add a minimum of four drives. One for the boot drive, two for the mirrored storage and one for the hot spare.

* Configure your network per your system requirements. Have the information ready when you configure your TrueNAS global network settings in the web interface.

## Deploying TrueNAS in VMWare ESXi

Launch your VMware ESXi interface using your login credentials.

### Setting Up Storage
Set up the storage needed for the new VM. First click on **Storage** and then the drive allocated for TrueNAS. Create the datastore directories for the ISO media and the TrueNAS virtual machine. 

{{< expand "Need more help setting up storage? Click here." "v" >}}
1. Select **Storage** on the navigation panel on the left side of the screen. 
   
   ![StorageDatastoresTab](/images/VMWareESXi/StorageDatastoresTab.png "Storage Datastores Tab")

2. Select the drive you allocated for the TrueNAS VM. The example uses *esxi07-hhd01*. The detailed view for this drive displays.
   
   ![SelectDatastoreBrowser](/images/VMWareESXi/SelectDatastoreBrowser.png "Select Datastore Browser")

3. Click **Datastore Browser** to open the browser window, and then click **Create directory**. Enter the name of the directory in the **New Directory** dialog. 
   
   ![NameNewDirectory](/images/VMWareESXi/NameNewDirectory.png "Name New Directory")

   Add two directories. The first directory is for the TrueNAS CORE storage needs the other for the TrueNAS-CORE iso file you downloaded (name directory ISOs). 
   Choose a name that is easy to identify on a list of virtual machines. The example uses *truenas1* as the directory name for the storage needs.
   Click **Create directory** in the **New directory** dialog to create the directory. 
   
   Click **Create directory** again to open the **New directory** dialog to create the second new directory. 
   When finished you should have both directories listed in the **Datastore Browser** window.

### Creating the Virtual Machine

After setting up the storage needs, create the new virtual machine. 
Select **Virtual Machines** on the  navigation panel on the left side of the screen. 

![VirtualMachinesScreen](/images/VMWareESXi/VirtualMachinesScreen.png "Virtual Machines Screen")

Select the storage drive for the TrueNAS VM and then click **Create/Register VM**. The **New virtual machine** creation wizard displays.
Use these settings:

* On the **Select a name and guest OS** wizard screen, select **Other** for **Guest OS family** and then **FreeBSD 12 or later versions (64-bit)** on the **Guest OS Version** dropdown list.

* On the **Customize settings** wizard screen set **CPU** to **2**, set **Memory** to **16 GB**, and **Hard disk 1** to **16 GB**.

  You need a minimum of two drives set to at least **16 GB**. To add a drive, click **Add hard disk**. 

  You can add more hard drive now or use the **Edit** option to add drives later after saving the new virtual machine. 
  To create a mirror layout you need at least three hard drives, one for boot and two to create the mirrored storage. 
  Add as many hard drives as you need to create your desired storage layout. You can add more drives later after you install TrueNAS.

{{< expand "Need more help using the ESXi VM Wizard? Click here." "v" >}}
To create the virtual machine for your TrueNAS, from the **Virtual Machines** screen:

1. Click **Create/Register VM** to display the configuration wizard. On the **Select creation type** screen select **Create a new virtual machine** and then click **Next**.
