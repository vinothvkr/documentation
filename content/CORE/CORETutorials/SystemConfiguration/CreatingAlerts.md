The alert system integrates with various third-party services.
Tuning alerts helps personalize TrueNAS to any highly-sensitive issues.

## Add an Alert Service

Go to **System > Alert Services** and click **ADD**.

Choose a **Type** and fill out the options specific to that alert service, then test the service configuration by clicking **SEND TEST ALERT**.

## Customize Alert Settings

Go to **System > Alert Settings**.

The UI groups alerts based on type.
For example, alerts related to pools appear in the **Storage** alert section.

Customize each alert **Warning Level** and **Frequency** using the drop-down menus.

Changing any of these options affects every configured alert service.

Click **SAVE** before leaving the page.
