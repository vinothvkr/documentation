## Description

Domain Name resolution, the process of mapping host or domain names, such as `mytruenas` or `truenas1.mycompany.com`, to their associated IP addresses can be achieved through a variety of methods. 
The quickest method is to read entries in the <file>hosts</file> file, which is a local text file containing a list of IP addresses mapped to domain/host names. Every operating system (OS) that communicates through the TCP/IP protocol has a <file>hosts</file> file.

The hosts file can be used to speed up name resolution if a DNS server is not available on the local network. A DNS server runs networking software that allows it to join the Domain Name System, which is the standard service used on the Internet for name resolution.
When adding entries to the <file>hosts</file> file of a TrueNAS system, use the TrueNAS web interface to save the entries directly to the configuration database. Do *not* edit the <file>hosts</file> file directly, as it will be overwritten by the configuration database during reboot.

## Errors

{{< expand "I’m trying to use NFS, SSH, and FTP, but I keep receiving “reverse DNS” or timeout errors." "v" >}}
The fastest domain name resolution method is for the operating system to read the <file>hosts</file> file, but if there are no matching entries in the <file>hosts</file> file, a DNS server is queried instead. This is a slower process as the OS has to find the DNS server, send it a query, and wait for an answer.
Timeout errors are common for some network protocols, such as SSH, FTP and NFS, as their connection requests can time out before a DNS server replies.
To speed up name resolution, add entries for commonly used hosts to the <file>hosts</file> file.

### Fix

To add an entry to the <file>hosts</file> file, log in to the TrueNAS web interface using a browser, and follow these steps:

1. Go to **Network > Global Configuration**.
3. Scroll down to the *Host name database* field and add an entry for the TrueNAS system in the format *IP_address space hostname*.
4. Click *Save*.
