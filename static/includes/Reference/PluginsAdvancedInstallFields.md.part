| Plugin Name | Required. Can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), dashes (-), and underscores (_). |
| Jail Name | Required. Can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), dashes (-), and underscores (_). |
| DHCP Autoconfigure IPv4 | Set to autoconfigure jail networking with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. VNET and Berkeley Packet Filter must also be enabled. |
| NAT | Network Address Translation (NAT). Transforms local network IP addresses into a single IP address. Set when the jail will share a single connection to the Internet with other systems on the network. |
| VNET | Set to use [VNET(9)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vnet) to emulate network devices for the jail. A fully virtualized per-jail network stack will be installed. |
| Berkeley Packet Filter | Set to use the Berkeley Packet Filter [(BPF(4))](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bpf) to data link layers in a protocol independent fashion. |
| vnet_default_interface | Set the default VNET interface. Only takes effect when VNET is set. Choose a specific interface or set to auto to use the interface that has the default route. Choose none to not set a default VNET interface. |
| IPv4 Interface | IPv4 interface for the jail. |
| IPv4 Address | Enter the IPv4 address for [VNET(9)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vnet) and shared IP jails. |
| IPv4 Netmask | IPv4 netmask for the jail. |
| IPv4 Default Router | A valid IPv4 address to use as the default route. Enter none to configure the jail with no IPv4 default route. A jail without a default route will not be able to access any networks. |
| AutoConfigure IPv6 | Set to use SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration) to autoconfigure IPv6 in the jail. |
| IPv6 Interface | IPv6 interface for the jail. |
| IPv6 Address | Enter the IPv6 address for [VNET(9)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vnet) and shared IP jails. |
| IPv6 Netmask | IPv6 prefix for the jail. |
| IPv6 Default Router | A valid IPv6 address to use as the default route. Enter none to configure the jail without an IPv6 default route. A jail without a default route will not be able to access any networks. |
| Auto Start | Set to auto-start the jail at system boot time. Jails are started and stopped based on iocage priority. Set in the priority field under Custom Properties. |
