**General Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| Number of servers * | Specify how many servers to create. Increase if NFS client responses are slow. Keep this less than or equal to the number of CPUs reported by `sysctl -n kern.smp.cpus` to limit CPU context switching. |
| Bind IP Addresses | Select IP addresses to listen to for NFS requests. Leave empty for NFS to listen to all available addresses. |

**NFSv4**

| | |
|-|-|
| Enable NFSv4 | Set to switch from NFSv3 to NFSv4. |
| NFSv3 ownership model for NFSv4 | Set when NFSv4 ACL support is needed without requiring the client and the server to sync users and groups. |
| Require Kerberos for NFSv4 | Set to force NFS shares to fail if the Kerberos ticket is unavailable. |

**Ports**

| | |
|-|-|
| mountd(8) bind port | Enter a port to bind [mountd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mountd). |
| rpc.statd(8) bind port | Enter a port to bind [rpc.statd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rpc.statd). |
| rpc.lockd(8) bind port | Enter a port to bind [rpc.lockd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rpc.lockd). |

**Other Options**

| | |
|-|-|
| Serve UDP NFS clients | Set if NFS clients need to use UDP. |
| Allow non-root mount | Set only if required by the NFS client. Set to allow serving non-root mount requests. |
| Support >16 groups | Set when a user is a member of more than 16 groups. This assumes group membership is configured correctly on the NFS server. |
| Log mountd(8) requests | Set to log [mountd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mountd) syslog requests. |
| Log rpc.statd(8) and rpc.lockd(8) | Set to log [rpc.statd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rpc.statd) and [rpc.lockd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rpc.lockd) syslog requests. |
