**Scrub Task**

| Name           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Pool           | Choose a pool to scrub. |
| Threshold days | Controls the task schedule by setting how many days must pass before a completed scrub can run again. If you schedule a scrub to run daily and set *Threshold days* to 7, the scrub attempts to run daily. If the scrub succeeds, it will check but won't run again until seven days pass. Using a multiple of seven ensures the scrub runs on the same weekday. |

| Schedule       | How often to run the scrub task. Choose one of the presets or *Custom* to use the **Advanced Scheduler**. |
| Enabled        | Unset to disable the scheduled scrub without deleting it. |
