**Advanced**

| | |
|-|-|
| Verbose logging | Set to log attempts to join the domain to /var/log/messages. |
| Allow Trusted Domains | When set, usernames do not include a domain name. Unset to force domain names to be prepended to user names. One possible reason for unsetting this value is to prevent username collisions when Allow Trusted Domains is set and there are identical usernames in more than one domain. |
| Use Default Domain | Unset to prepend the domain name to the username. Unset to prevent name collisions when Allow Trusted Domains is set and multiple domains use the same username. |
| Allow DNS updates | Set to enable Samba to do DNS updates when joining a domain. |
| Disable FreeNAS Cache | Set to disable caching AD users and groups. This can help when unable to bind to a domain with a large number of users or groups. |

| Kerberos Principal | Select the location of the principal in the keytab created in Directory Services > Kerberos Keytabs. |
| Computer Account OU | The OU in which new computer accounts are created. The OU string is read from top to bottom without RDNs. Slashes ("/") are used as delimiters, like Computers/Servers/NAS. The backslash ("\\") is used to escape characters but not as a separator. Backslashes are interpreted at multiple levels and might require doubling or even quadrupling to take effect. When this field is blank, new computer accounts are created in the Active Directory default OU. |
| AD Timeout | Number of seconds before timeout. To view the AD connection status, open the interface Task Manager. |
| DNS Timeout | Number of seconds before a timeout. Increase this value if AD DNS queries time out. |
